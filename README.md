# Documented implementations of predictive algorithms in R

As of this writing, the following have been implemented:
- Multiple linear regression (computed using the normal equations)

## Installation

Run `devtools::install_github("cxzhang4/predict")`. 

## Credit

A large part of the credit for this implementation goes to Martin Binder and anyone else who may have prepared Homework 02 for the Advanced Programming in R class at LMU Munich. 
It went much more smoothly because I could refer to implementation of simple linear regression provided there.
